# # Q.3 Write a program to find intersection of two arrays? For Example. Sample input: arr1[] = [1, 3, 4, 5, 7]; arr2[] = [2, 3, 5, 6] the intersection is [ 3,5]

# import numpy as np

# arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
# arr2 = np.array([4,6,7,8,9,])
# inter = np.array([])
# for i in arr1:
#   for j in arr2:
#     if (i == j):
#       inter = np.append(inter, [i])

# print(inter)
